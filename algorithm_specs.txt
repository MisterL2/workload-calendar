Factors that should affect which task is done first:

Value (calculated based on Priority)
Deadline proximity (how close to the deadline)
Current Progress made (Better to finish a task that is 90% done than start a new one; decreases amount of parallel tasks)
Value only on completion? (Is there continuous value generated by doing this, as in i.e. a learning project or generating work hours OR is it project-based (like a report) and the value is only gained if it is completed and almost 0 if incomplete)
<Maybe> Value gain per minute (probably a bad idea?)

Preference should be given to tasks that can be completed
