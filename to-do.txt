TO-DO
-> Test UI confirmation sequence
-> Mark tasks as completed
-> Differentiate between active and finished tasks!
-> Display the current schedule-week
-> Go through schedule-weeks in UI (with commands like "next", "previous") and check constraints on weeks that are too far in the past
-> Display schedule-week for date given from user


-> Add Task-Appointments (fixed time appointment that belongs to a task and is counted towards its hours. Be careful with this! This needs to be added to i.e. onInit-recentlyCompleted in UI as well.
