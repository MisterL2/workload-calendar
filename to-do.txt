TO-DO
-> Make schedule calculation consider START DATES of recurring tasks (do not allow scheduling before start dates; update timegraph
-> Properly display recurring tasks
-> Ability to remove tasks
-> Ability to remove interval tasks
-> Ability to complete tasks manually (needs to trigger a lastWorkConfirmed procedure immediately to avoid async)
-> Test UI confirmation sequence
-> Go through schedule-weeks in UI (with commands like "next", "previous") and check constraints on weeks that are too far in the past


-> Add Task-Appointments (fixed time appointment that belongs to a task and is counted towards its hours. Be careful with this! This needs to be added to i.e. onInit-recentlyCompleted in UI as well.
