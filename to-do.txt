TO-DO
-> WHEN USING ADDHISTORY, HANDLE CASES AFFECTING THE CURRENT DAY (i.e. completed timeslots for today need to be added in history, future timeslots need to be part of newdays)
-> Ability to remove tasks
-> Ability to remove interval tasks
-> Interval tasks need to auto-set deadline
-> Ability to complete tasks manually (needs to trigger a lastWorkConfirmed procedure immediately to avoid async)
-> Test UI confirmation sequence
-> Go through schedule-weeks in UI (with commands like "next", "previous") and check constraints on weeks that are too far in the past

ISSUES
-> When updating a schedule, is willing to update into the past as well. Need to properly persist schedule... Reloading from deterministic algorithm does not make sense: any new task added changes the parameters and hence the outcome, so a high prio task might be scheduled waaay into the past. Limiting this with start/end times also doesn't work, because the old schedule might not be possible in those constraints or change according to deadline proximity...

-> Add Task-Appointments (fixed time appointment that belongs to a task and is counted towards its hours. Be careful with this! This needs to be added to i.e. onInit-recentlyCompleted in UI as well.
