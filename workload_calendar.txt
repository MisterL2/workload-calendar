main menu:
-> active tasks overview
-> set standard daily workhours for weekdays / weekend
-> override with custom workhours for current day
-> generate day schedule for these hours on the spot using a deterministic algorithm (no randomness)

tasks:
-> deadline
-> minimum workload (hours)
-> maximum workload (hours)
-> requires (other task(s) that needs to be done beforehand)
-> priority

The algorithm then goes backwards from the deadline, starting with the buffer (max_workload - min_workload) and then the work time. Then takes a look at that task's requirements and tries to schedule them in.
Algorithm needs to give priorities accordingly and find the best possible schedule. Given the known info about to-do tasks, it will then display the current day's schedule. If the day's schedule isn't full (because there is still some spare time to complete other tasks), then the closest tasks (time-wise) should be pulled forwards.

Ability to add in normal calendar appointments for fixed appointments, that are shown in the daily schedule as they would in a calendar, and have to be scheduled around.

Ability to add/remove workload to tasks after creating them (with validation for >0)
Ability to change deadlines for tasks after creating them (with validation for compatibility with previous tasks)
